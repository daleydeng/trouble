# trouble

An async first Rust BLE stack with a future goal of qualification.

The `trouble-host` is based on [`bleps`](https://github.com/bjoernQ/bleps) but has been adopted to work with [`bt-hci`](https://github.com/alexmoon/bt-hci). 

## Example

See `examples` for example applications. Currently there is only one, for the nRF52 based using the [`nrf-sdc`](https://github.com/alexmoon/nrf-sdc) crate.
